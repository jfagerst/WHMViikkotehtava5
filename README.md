### Exercise. TodoList with Reducer

Extend todo app from previous weekly assignment by using useReducer to manage tasks. All states and related functions should be implemented as a custom hook. Create hooks folder and create useTodos custom hook. Data (state) of the list is saved (on memory) using useReducer, which also implements actions for adding and removing rows. There is no need to persist data (e.g. AsyncStorage).
